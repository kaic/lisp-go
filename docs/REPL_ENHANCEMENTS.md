# REPL Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

This document tracks the enhancement of our lisp-go REPL, inspired by advanced Clojure REPL setups. The goal is to transform our basic REPL into a professional development environment.

## Inspiration Source

Based on: https://gist.github.com/mtnygard/9b2dd3c88b3309d82210b84f33ee954d

This Clojure REPL setup demonstrates how to create a developer-friendly interactive environment with:
- Enhanced error reporting (Expound)
- Better interactive experience (Rebel Readline)
- Development tool integration (nREPL, CIDER)
- Visual polish (colorful startup)

## Learning Goals

### Understanding REPL Architecture
- [ ] How REPLs work internally (Read-Eval-Print-Loop cycle)
- [ ] Difference between basic and enhanced REPLs
- [ ] Integration with development workflows

### Go-Specific Learning
- [ ] Terminal manipulation in Go
- [ ] Command-line interfaces and user interaction
- [ ] Error handling and user-friendly messaging
- [ ] Integration with Go development tools

### Development Experience
- [ ] What makes a REPL pleasant to use
- [ ] How visual feedback improves productivity
- [ ] Command history and editing capabilities
- [ ] Syntax highlighting implementation

## Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Visual Enhancement
- [ ] Create colorful startup banner/logo for lisp-go
- [ ] Implement colored output for different types (numbers, strings, errors)
- [ ] Add pretty-printing for Lisp data structures

### Phase 2: Interactive Improvements
- [ ] Command history functionality
- [ ] Multi-line input support
- [ ] Basic tab completion for built-in functions
- [ ] Line editing capabilities (backspace, arrow keys)

### Phase 3: Better Error Handling
- [ ] User-friendly error messages instead of Go stack traces
- [ ] Context-aware error suggestions
- [ ] Syntax error highlighting with position indicators
- [ ] Help system for common errors

### Phase 4: Development Integration
- [ ] REPL-specific commands (:help, :doc, :exit, etc.)
- [ ] Function documentation lookup
- [ ] Variable inspection capabilities
- [ ] Debug mode for step-through execution

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for input
- [ ] Auto-completion for user-defined functions
- [ ] Session save/load functionality
- [ ] Integration with Go debugging tools

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Libraries to Consider
- **Readline functionality**: github.com/chzyer/readline or similar
- **Color output**: github.com/fatih/color
- **Terminal manipulation**: golang.org/x/term
- **Command parsing**: github.com/spf13/cobra for REPL commands

### Architecture Decisions
- Keep REPL separate from core interpreter
- Design extensible command system
- Maintain backward compatibility with basic REPL
- Consider configuration file for user preferences

## Progress Tracking

### Current State (Milestone 0)
- Basic REPL exists in internal/repl/repl.go
- Simple Read-Eval-Print loop
- Basic error display

### What We're Building Towards
A REPL experience similar to:
```

## Learning Journal

### Key Concepts to Master
1. **REPL Design Patterns**: How professional REPLs are structured
2. **Terminal Programming**: ANSI codes, cursor control, input handling
3. **User Experience**: What makes a CLI tool pleasant to use
4. **Error Communication**: Turning technical errors into helpful messages

### Questions to Explore
- How do other language REPLs (Python, Node.js, etc.) enhance user experience?
- What are the minimal features needed for a "good" REPL?
- How can we balance simplicity with functionality?
- What Go libraries provide the best terminal interaction capabilities?
